## Features
- Provides fully automatic **START, PAUSE, SPLIT, and RESET** functionality
- Supports Steam, BGamer, and Plutonium versions of T5 (Black Ops 1)
- Utilizes game time identical to popular hooked WSplit timers for accurate timing tied directly to game ticks
- Automatically splits for **ALL ROUNDS**
- Offers two configurable split modes to define when splits are triggered:
   - White Mode - Splits as soon as the new round number appears on screen
   - Red Mode - Splits when the round officially begins and zombies actually start spawning
- Includes:
   - `bo1 autosplitter.asl` - Core script that controls the timer 
   - `bo1 subsplits.lss` - Splits config file that stores the segment names and split times
      - Main splits every 10 rounds and round 163
      - Subsplits for every round in between
      - Reference split times from notable games, specifically for comparison use with `bo1 layout - main split deltas.lsl`

   - `bo1 layout - full splits info.lsl`
   - `bo1 layout - main split deltas.lsl`

> [!NOTE]  
> Current version does **NOT** split correctly on the map **Moon**. Teleporting to and from No Man's Land breaks the round transition logic.

## Layout Previews

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The layouts shown below are just a few examples to highlight how insanely customizable LiveSplit can be. I highly encourage you to explore its settings and components to build a layout that fits your own style and needs.
>
> When creating your own layout, keep two things in mind:
> 1. You must include the Scriptable Auto Splitter component and point the path to `bo1 autosplitter.asl`
> 2. Always use Game Time wherever applicable (not Real Time)

> [!TIP]
> To change the reference comparison:
> - Right Click > Compare Against
>
> To add a new reference set:
> - Right Click > Edit Splits > Add Comparison
> - Enter split times in the new column under the **Game Time** tab and remember to Save Splits when done. You can paste on this page if it's the right format.

## Usage & Tips
- Launch LiveSplit before Black Ops 1 or while at the main menu.
- **Not working?** Try running LiveSplit as administrator
   - *To always run as admin. Right click `LiveSplit.exe` > Properties > Compatibility tab > Check "Run this program as an administrator" box > Apply*
- **Customization:** LiveSplit is highly customizable.
   - Customize fonts, colors, and more in Edit Layout > Layout Settings.
   - Feel free to add, remove, edit, re-order components to fit your needs.
   - You could even add other tools like [Strett's Velocity Graph](https://github.com/strett/LiveSplit-Velocity-Graph-For-BO1-BO2-WAW-MW2) to the same layout.
- LiveSplit automatically remembers your last used splits. If it doesnâ€™t, simply open `bo1 subsplits.lss` to restore them
   - This will also open your preferred layout, assuming you linked the layout to `bo1 subsplits.lss`

- The main font used in my layout examples is [Digital 7 (Mono) by Style-7](https://www.dafont.com/digital-7.font)
