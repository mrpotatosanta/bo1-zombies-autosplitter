# LiveSplit Autosplitter for Call of Duty: Black Ops 1 Zombies

This repository contains a LiveSplit Autosplitter designed for Call of Duty: Black Ops 1 Zombies speedruns and high-round attempts.

> [!WARNING]  
> Skipping the map loading screen using a controller (X/A Button) will often break splitting functionality for that game. **Use your mouse's Left Click to skip for best results.**

> [!NOTE]  
> Current version does **NOT** split correctly on the map **Moon**. Teleporting to and from No Man's Land breaks the round transition logic.

6. Edit Layout:

   - Browse... next to "Script Path" > `bo1 autosplitter.asl`

> [!TIP]

## Usage & Tips
- For best results, launch LiveSplit before Black Ops 1 or while at the main menu.
- **Not working?** Try running LiveSplit as administrator
  - *To always run as admin. Right click LiveSplit.exe > Properties > Compatibility tab > Check "Run this program as an administrator" box > Apply*
- **Customization:** LiveSplit is highly customizable.
    - Customize fonts, colors, and more in **Edit Layout > Layout Settings**.
    - Feel free to add, remove, or re-order components to fit your needs.
    - You could even add other tools like **[Strett's Velocity Graph](https://github.com/strett/LiveSplit-Velocity-Graph-For-BO1-BO2-WAW-MW2)** to the same layout.
- **Streaming:** To reduce clutter on stream, you can either remove the "Splits" component from the layout entirely or crop the window capture in OBS to only show the timers.
- LiveSplit automatically remembers your last used splits. If it doesnâ€™t, simply open `bo1 splits.lss` to restore them

## Credits
- Big shoutout to [lveez](https://github.com/lveez/bo1-timers) and [5and5](https://github.com/5and5/LiveSplitAutoSplitterForBlackOpsZombies) for their code, which gave me a base understanding of ASL scripting and useful memory addresses to build off of.
