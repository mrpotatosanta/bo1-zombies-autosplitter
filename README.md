## LiveSplit Autosplitter for Call of Duty: Black Ops 1 Zombies 

> [!TIP]  
> The font for Timer and Times is [Digital 7 Mono Regular](https://www.dafont.com/digital-7.font) (from WSplit). If missing, LiveSplit will substitute another font.

> [!NOTE]  
> Current version does **NOT** split correctly on Moon. Teleporting to and from No Man's Land breaks the round transition logic.

- LiveSplit automatically remembers your last used splits and keeps them open. If it doesnâ€™t, simply open `bo1 splits.lss` to restore them
