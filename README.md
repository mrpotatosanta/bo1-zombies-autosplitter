## LiveSplit Autosplitter for Call of Duty: Black Ops 1 Zombies 

> [!WARNING]  
> Skipping the map loading screen using a controller (X/A Button) will often break splitting functionality entirely for that game. Use Left Click skip for best results.

> [!NOTE]  
> Current version does **NOT** split correctly on Moon. Teleporting to and from No Man's Land breaks the round transition logic.

> [!TIP]  
> The font used for both the Timer and Times in my layout template is [Digital 7 Mono Regular](https://www.dafont.com/digital-7.font), the same font used in WSplit. If it's missing, LiveSplit will substitute another font.

### Usage
- Launch LiveSplit before Black Ops 1, or while at the main menu for best results
- Not working? Try running LiveSplit as administrator
  - To always run as admin. Right click LiveSplit.exe > Properties > Compatibility tab > Check "Run this program as an administrator" box > Apply
- LiveSplit is highly customizable
  - Edit layout > Layout Settings to change just about anything
  - Add, remove, or adjust layout components to fit your needs
  - You could even add [Strett's Velocity Graph](https://github.com/strett/LiveSplit-Velocity-Graph-For-BO1-BO2-WAW-MW2) to the same layout if you wanted
- To reduce clutter on stream/recordings, crop the OBS source to only show the Detailed Timer layout component
  - Or just remove the Splits layout component entirely
- LiveSplit automatically remembers your last used splits and keeps them open. If it doesnâ€™t, simply open `bo1 splits.lss` to restore them

### Credits
- Big shoutout to [lveez](https://github.com/lveez/bo1-timers) and [5and5](https://github.com/5and5/LiveSplitAutoSplitterForBlackOpsZombies) for their code, which gave me a base understanding of ASL scripting and useful memory addresses to build off of.
