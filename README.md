# LiveSplit Autosplitter for Call of Duty: Black Ops 1 Zombies

This repository contains a LiveSplit Autosplitter designed for Call of Duty: Black Ops 1 Zombies speedruns and high round attempts.

Developed and maintained by [mrpotatosanta](https://www.twitch.tv/mrpotatosanta)

> [!WARNING]
> Sometimes, although rarely, splitting may fail on initial map load due to a memory issue.
>
> **Perform a "Fast Restart" immediately after map load to guarantee functionality.**

> [!NOTE]
> Current version does **NOT** split correctly on the map **Moon**. Teleporting to and from No Man's Land breaks the round transition logic.

---

## Features
- **Full Automation:** Provides automatic **START, PAUSE, SPLIT, and RESET** functionality
- **Game Support:** Supports Steam, BGamer, and Plutonium versions of T5 (Black Ops 1)
- **Accurate Timing:** Utilizes game time tied directly to game ticks (identical to hooked WSplit) for maximum accuracy
- **Configurable Splits:** Automatically splits for all rounds and offers two configurable split modes:
    - **White Mode:** Splits as soon as the new round number appears on screen
    - **Red Mode (Default):** Splits when the round officially begins and zombies start spawning

### Included Files
- `bo1 autosplitter.asl`: The core script for timer control
- `bo1 subsplits.lss`: Split configuration file with splits every round. Includes main splits at 10-round intervals and round 163, **plus reference split times for comparison**
- `bo1 layout - classic wsplit style.lsl`
- `bo1 layout - full splits info.lsl`
- `bo1 layout - main split deltas.lsl`

## Usage & Tips
- Launch LiveSplit before Black Ops 1 or while at the main menu.
- **Not working?** Try running LiveSplit as administrator
   - *To always run as admin. Right click `LiveSplit.exe` > Properties > Compatibility tab > Check "Run this program as an administrator" box > Apply*
- **Customization:** LiveSplit is highly customizable.
   - Customize fonts, colors, and more in Edit Layout > Layout Settings.
   - Feel free to add, remove, edit, re-order components to fit your needs.
   - You could even add other tools like [Strett's Velocity Graph](https://github.com/strett/LiveSplit-Velocity-Graph-For-BO1-BO2-WAW-MW2) to the same layout.
- LiveSplit automatically remembers your last used splits. If it doesnâ€™t, simply open `bo1 subsplits.lss` to restore them
   - This will also open your preferred layout, assuming you linked the layout to `bo1 subsplits.lss`
